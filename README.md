# Networked Multi-agent RL (NMARL)
This repo implements MARL algorithms for networked system control, with observability and communication of each agent limited to its neighborhood. For fair comparison, all algorithms are applied to A2C agents, and they are classified into two groups. IA2C contains non-communicative policies which utilize neighborhood information only, whereas MA2C contains communicative policies with certain communication protocols.
